### ⚙️ Installation (anaconda)
```commandline
conda create -n dialokg -y python=3.7 && source activate dialokg
pip install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### 🏋️ Training
```shell
# training using a single gpu
python train.py --dataset <DATASET-NAME> --params_file config/gpt2/params.json --device cuda

# training in a distributed setting
python -m torch.distributed.launch --dataset <DATASET-NAME> --params_file config/gpt2/params.json --device cuda
```
Valid dataset names: **incar**, **camrest**, **woz2.1** .

### 🎯 Evaluation
```shell
python eval.py --generate runs/dialokg-gpt2/<DATASET-NAME> --dataset <DATASET-NAME>  --generation_params_file config/gpt2/generation_params.json --eval_dataset test  --output_file outputs/<DATASET-NAME>-output.json --top_weights 7
```

Note that:
- the best parameters are reported in the paper.
- reported results are obtained from distributed training.

    abstract = "Task-oriented dialogue generation is challenging since the underlying knowledge is often dynamic and effectively incorporating knowledge into the learning process is hard. It is particularly challenging to generate both human-like and informative responses in this setting. Recent research primarily focused on various knowledge distillation methods where the underlying relationship between the facts in a knowledge base is not effectively captured. In this paper, we go one step further and demonstrate how the structural information of a knowledge graph can improve the system{'}s inference capabilities. Specifically, we propose DialoKG, a novel task-oriented dialogue system that effectively incorporates knowledge into a language model. Our proposed system views relational knowledge as a knowledge graph and introduces (1) a structure-aware knowledge embedding technique, and (2) a knowledge graph-weighted attention masking strategy to facilitate the system selecting relevant information during the dialogue generation. An empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of DialoKG over state-of-the-art methods on several standard benchmark datasets.",
